# 👋 Welcome to Controlled Chaos

Hi, I’m Kylo— I tend to dive headfirst into complex, low-level projects without reading the docs because it builds character (And bugs. And trauma.).

I thrive in low-level chaos: kernel hacking, bootloaders, weird memory bugs, and reinventing the wheel because… why not?

## What I’m Doing Now
	• CarbonLD — a linker for the CarbonOS project I probably wasn’t qualified to start… but here we are.

## Interests

- OSDev, compilers, and things most people wisely avoid
- Debugging kernel stack overflows at 3AM
